# Minimal Strength

A minimalist Progressive Web App (PWA) for tracking strength training workouts, specifically designed for pull-ups and dips progression.

## Features

## Workout Logic

- Start with 5 sets of 1 rep for each exercise
- Complete sets by tapping "Complete Set" 
- Rest timer automatically starts between sets
- After completing all exercises, choose to progress or repeat same level
- Progression adds one rep to the first possible set (e.g., 1-1-1-1-1 â†’ 2-1-1-1-1)
